                        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Principles</strong></p>
                        <p class="mb-3">Personal data are all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses, which are an expression of a person's identity.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">We collect, process, and use personal data (including IP addresses) only if there is a legal basis for doing so or if you have given us your consent, e.g., as part of a registration.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Legal Basis</strong></p>
                        <p class="mb-3">We and the service providers we commission process your personal data to provide the website with our legitimate interest in providing information about our company, fulfilling our legal obligations in the area of data security, our legitimate interest in eliminating disruptions and ensuring the security of our offerings, and generally our legitimate interest in asserting and defending our rights.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Storage Duration</strong></p>
                        <p class="mb-3">We store your data as long as it is necessary to provide our online offering and the associated services or as long as we have a legitimate interest in further storage. We then delete your data, except for data that we must continue to store to fulfill legal obligations.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Recipients of Personal Data</strong></p>
                        <p class="mb-3">In the course of our business activities, we work with various external entities. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to these external entities. We only pass on personal data to external entities if this is necessary for contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only transfer personal data of our customers based on a valid processing contract. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Transfer to Recipients Outside the EEA</strong></p>
                        <p class="mb-3">We may also transfer personal data to recipients located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in so-called third countries. In this case, we ensure before the transfer that the recipient either has an adequate level of data protection or that your consent to the transfer is present.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Hosting and Data Collection through Server Log Files</strong></p>
                        <p class="mb-3">Our hosting provider collects the following data in so-called log files, which your browser transmits: IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, transferred data volume, website from which the request originates, and information about the browser and operating system.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">This is necessary to display our website and ensure its stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3">There is no tracking, and we do not have direct access to this data.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3">We use the following hosting provider to provide our website:</p>
